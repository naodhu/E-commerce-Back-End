# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End

The e-commerce backend application provides APIs to manage products, categories, and tags. The APIs are designed to enable the application to be used as the backend for an e-commerce site. The APIs provide functionality to:

Create, read, update, and delete products, categories, and tags
Associate products with categories and tags
Perform CRUD operations on user authentication data (email and password)
The application uses Sequelize, an ORM that allows developers to interact with relational databases using JavaScript. Sequelize provides an easy-to-use, promise-based API that simplifies database operations.


## Installation

  To run this application on your local machine, follow the steps below:

```bash

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the command npm install in the root of the project directory.

3. Set up a local MySQL database by running the schema.sql file located in the db directory.

4. Update the .env file with your local MySQL database credentials.

5. Seed the database with sample data by running the command npm run seed.

6. Start the application by running the command npm start.
```
    
## Lessons Learned

* Building a back-end application with Node.js and Express.js.

* Using an ORM (Sequelize) to interact with a MySQL database.

* Building a RESTful API.

* Implementing user authentication and authorization.
